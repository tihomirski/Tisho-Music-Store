Tisho-Music-Store

Hello there! 

This project is aimed to be as mine portfolio. It is released with IntelliJ Idea, Spring MVC, Java 8, Apache Tomcat 8.5, Hibernate database, AngularJS and Bootstrap. Following are some explanations.

1. Database - Perhaps you will need to have installed Hibernate Database. I used version H2 1.4.195 locally. I omitted the config credentials in applicationContext.xml. Perhaps, in that file you should also specify the H2 DB url.

2. There are three user roles - guest, user and admin. There is only one user already registered - the administrator. Username: admin / Password: admin. You can register as a user and have your credentials in order to "purchase" products on the site.
